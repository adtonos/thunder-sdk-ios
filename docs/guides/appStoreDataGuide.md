# AppStore Data Guide

Since the release of iOS 14.5, developers must now declare the data they use in the App Privacy section of App Store Connect. In order to assist you in declaring the correct data being collected, we have created an simple guide.

  

>**Important**
While we can help you decide what’s right for your app. If you are unsure what you need to declare, we recommend seeking advice from an appropriate professional.

  

Further information on what is now required can be found on the Apple developer section for app privacy details.

  

## Step 1: Edit Data Types.

To declare the data sources used by SandstormSDK, select the App Privacy section on your app’s App Store settings page, and click Edit next to Data Types.

## Step 2: Usage Data.

Go to Usage Data section.

Select Other Usage Data.

## Step 3: Location Data Types.

Go to Location section.

Select Precise Location.

Select Coarse Location.

## Step 4: Justify the Data Used.

Once the data used has been selected, you need to justify what the data is used for.

Back to App Privacy.

Click on Edit next to Precise Location in Location section.

For each of the data types listed above, you should select Developer’s Advertising or Marketing

## Step 5: Data Linkage.

You may also need to declare whether the data is linked to the user’s identity, or whether it is used for tracking. In both cases, SandstormSDK does not track users’ identites.
